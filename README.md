# WNAB - We Need a Budget

A modern budget tracking application that connects to bank services to help users better track their expenditures and manage their finances. Inspired by YNAB (You Need A Budget).

## Project Overview

WNAB is designed to be a comprehensive budgeting solution that provides users with real-time insights into their spending habits, automated transaction categorization, and powerful budgeting tools. The application focuses on connecting to financial institutions through secure APIs to provide seamless expense tracking.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Platform Support
- **Mobile Application**: .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- **Web Application**: Blazor Server/WebAssembly
- **Cross-platform**: Supports iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Web

### Core Technologies
- **.NET 9+**: Primary development framework
- **Blazor**: Web UI framework
- **MAUI**: Cross-platform mobile/desktop framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: Database ORM
- **ASP.NET Core**: Web API backend

## Project Structure

The application is composed of several key modules:

### üèóÔ∏è Core Components
