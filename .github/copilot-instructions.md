Ask Questions. Do one thing at a time. Do not do more than what was asked. Try not to modify code. Use durable, readable, and maintainable code.
Use the boring solution. Do not introduce extra complexity like asynchronous things except where ABSOLUTELY neccessary.
Every time you finish a task or task list, read the files in and compare against what was asked.
Read errors before you move on.
Unless given express permission: Do not run the program, but you can build and run tests. Do this after you have finished a todo or request.
The first thing you should try when you see an error is a package restore with dotnet restore.
